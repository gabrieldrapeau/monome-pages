== Page Description ==

The Ableton Clip Control page is another implementation of the nice Ableton Clip Laucnher by Tom.
I built this patch as the last step to my configuration session.
Indeed, I use Ableton Live since 3 years and was very impressed by the [http://www.monolake.de/technology/ monodeck II] by Robert Henke (aka Monolake)
The part that stuck me was the clip matrix part ; it permits to hide your screen, your mouse and gives you all the feeling you need to perform.

This patch was easier to code than the path I follow to understand what I wanted to do during live performance. That said, it is probably a very julien bayle patch and won't fit exactly with your idea/set.
By the way, I share it here :)

Enjoy!


== 64 Layout (only this layout for the moment) ==

|| clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip ||
|| clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip ||
|| clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip ||
|| clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip || clip ||

|| notes/stop || notes/stop || notes/stop || notes/stop || notes/stop || notes/stop || notes/stop || notes/stop ||
|| pvco || nxco || -bpm || +bpm || ---- || ---- || ---- || ---- ||


Each column represents one track in Ableton Live's session view.  The clip buttons trigger clips from top to bottom in the track.

The notes/stop buttons have 2 states:
 * if a clip is playing in the track, it shows you midi note feedback from this track by led blinking & if you press it, it stops the clip playing in the track.
 * if nothing is playing, led is off & pressing it has no effect.

The pvco and nxco buttons switch to the previous clip offset or the next clip offset.  Each clip offset shows you a particular slice of the Ableton session view (from top to bottom).  These buttons move your view up and down the ableton clip matrix.

the -bpm and +bpm buttons subtract 1 or add 1 to the current tempo.

---- means no functions (for the moment ;)

Midi notes feedback
In order to receive midi notes feedback from live, you'll have to make it sends them to you ;)
If you use an instrument in a midi track in Ableton Live, none midi notes can be exported/sent outside of Ableton Live. You need to create as many midi tracks to make the trick as you have midi track with instruments.
For instance, you have a midi track with a pretty operator. You want to send midi notes outside of this track to get feedback. You create another midi track and set:
- midi from <your operator midi track>
- Monitor <IN>
- midi to <Midi Yoke output: 1> (only Midi Yoke Input can be handle in monome-pages apps)
I mapped channel 9 to column 1, 10 to 2 etc etc
