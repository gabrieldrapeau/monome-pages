#summary Detailed information about the Ableton Clip Control page.

== Page Description ==

The Ableton Clip Control page uses the LiveOSC project to communicate with Ableton Live.  Setup of LiveOSC is described in the document below.  Note that at the time of this writing LiveOSC is only available for Windows users.

Each column represents one track in Ableton Live's session view.  The clip buttons trigger clips from top to bottom in the track.  The recX buttons arm or disarm their associated track for recording.  The stpX buttons send a stop signal to their associated track.

The notes/stop buttons have 2 states:
 * if a clip is playing in the track, it shows you midi note feedback from this track by led blinking & if you press it, it stops the clip playing in the track.
 * if nothing is playing, led is off & pressing it has no effect.

The pvco and nxco buttons switch to the previous clip offset or the next clip offset.  Each clip offset shows you a particular slice of the Ableton session view (from top to bottom).  These buttons move your view up and down the ableton clip matrix.

the -bpm and +bpm buttons subtract 1 or add 1 to the current tempo.

---- means no functions (for the moment ;)
