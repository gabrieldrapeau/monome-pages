That's it! You can now create an Ableton Clip Launcher page to try it out.

If you are getting runtime errors when you select LiveOSC in Ableton:

I got the runtime error because the c:\python22\lib folder wasn't in the PYTHONPATH when live was running its scripts.

Setting the PYTHONPATH fixed it.

control panel -> system -> advanced tab -> environment variables button.

Either edit your current PYTHONPATH, or add a new environment variable, and call it that.

Make its value: [c:\python22;c:\python22\lib] (without the square brackets). Not sure if you strictly need both paths, but it works.
