#summary Hi there, pages users

= Introduction =

I am currently developing an extension and set of pages for "pages" that will give it microtonal capabilities via Reaktor.  This page will send frequencies and notes to reaktor via OSC (the midi standard does not currently support microtuning very well).

I am open to setting this system up with other applications besides reaktor.  It shouldn't be too hard!

I should have a working beta ready sometime in the next week.

*includes numerous operations that can be done on the "grid" of notes, including rotation, horizontal and vertical flip, and so on
*there will be some custom sequencers for working with these pitch sets as well.
