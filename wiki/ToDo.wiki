#summary Items planned for future releases.

Items for 0.2 release:

  * check midi keyboard for monophonic behavior
  * command line option to load a configuration file
  * add feedback about which midi devices are selected, on the pages and on the ableton config window
  * try to add adc support to external app page
  * ~~implement clip length info for PagesMIDI~~
  * ~~get rid of the toFloat junk and just use integers and multiply/divide them by some factor to get an approximate floating point value~~
  * make ableton update rate configurable
  * make sure monomeserial ports are cleanly closed when configuration changes
  * ~~test PagesMIDI with 25+ clips in a track and do whatever i can to make it stable~~

  * Add a way to reorder pages within the application.
