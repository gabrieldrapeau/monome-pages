#summary The user manual for the pages application.

= Project Summary =

Pages was designed to allow multiple applications to run simultaneously on a single monome device.  One page (application) is in focus at any given time and will receive input from the monome and output led changes to the monome.  The focused page can be changed by holding down the page change button (the bottom right button on the monome) and pushing another button on the bottom row.

Pages doesn't make any sound on its own; it is intended to run alongside applications like Ableton Live and Max/MSP.  It is not limited to these two applications and should work with any applications capable of sending/receiving MIDI and/or OSC.  Think of it as a somewhat general purpose MIDI/OSC router for interfacing monome(s) with other audio applications.

There are currently 5 pages available, and any number of monomes can be configured with any combination of these 5 pages.  The pages adapt to the size of the monome you are using.  Each page supports 8x8 (40h/64), 16x8 (128), and 16x16 (256) sized monomes and will automatically adapt based on your configuration.

= Summary of Available Pages =

* MIDI Sequencer

The MIDI Sequencer page turns a monome into a MIDI clock-driven step sequencer that sends MIDI note on/off messages.  It has approximately 240 banks of 32x15 steps each (that's 32 steps wide, 15 instruments deep).  Basic features such as copy and clear pattern/bank have been implemented, as well as a simple pattern generator and pattern alteration algorithm.

* MIDI Keyboard

The MIDI Keyboard is a basic keyboard interface that sends a MIDI note on message when a button is pressed and a MIDI note off message when a button is released.  The buttons are automatically mapped to musical keys/scales.  Up to 6 instruments can be controlled from a single instance of the MIDI Keyboard by sending MIDI note messages on different MIDI channels.  The key and scale can be selected on the monome.  Currently 4 scales are implemented with 12 keys, for a total of 48 possible key/scale combinations.

* MIDI Faders

The MIDI Faders page turns the monome into a set of virtual faders where each column represents the MIDI CC value of one parameter.  There is a variable delay that controls how fast the faders move from value to value.

* External Application

The External Application page is used to route an external application (ie. mlr, bboingg, flin, dj64, etc.) through a page.  This allows you to run multiple applications simultaneously on a single monome device and switch between them.  For example, you could run mlr on page 1, bboingg on page 2, etc.  You could also run quadrants or hub configured with a few applications of their own through a page.

* Ableton Clip Launcher

The Ableton Clip Launcher page is an interface to launch clips, stop tracks, or record enable/disable tracks in Ableton Live.  It is currently implemented to use the LiveOSC project to communicate with Ableton Live (so you'll need LiveOSC installed and configured for this to work).  It polls the state of Ableton Live and updates the page according to the state of the clips, so it is always in sync with the state of Ableton Live.

= Setup Guide =

== Downloading Pages ==

The latest version of pages can be downloaded from the Downloads page of this project:

http://code.google.com/p/monome-pages/downloads/list

It has been compiled to run with Java version 1.5 or higher, so you may need to upgrade your version of Java to run the application.  You can run "java -version" from a command line to see what version of Java you currently have installed.

== Virtual MIDI Devices ==

You will need to install/enable a set of virtual MIDI devices if you wish to route pages MIDI applications to an audio application (ie. Ableton Live).  Most users will want to do this.

=== Windows Virtual MIDI Devices Setup ===

[http://www.midiox.com/myoke.htm MIDI Yoke] or [http://members.nextra.at/hubwin/midi.html Hubi's MIDI Loopback Device] should both work fine for Windows users.  Follow the instructions on the web sites to install.

=== OS X Virtual MIDI Devices Setup ===

The IAC driver comes standard with OS X and will work fine for OS X users.  A tutorial on enabling this driver can be found here: http://fox-gieg.com/tutorials/2007/inter-application-midi/

OS X users will also need to install the mmj.jar file and associated files found here: http://www.humatic.de/htools/mmj.htm

== Monome Serial Setup ==

Monome Serial should be configured so that each monome device has a unique prefix.  The standard OSC ports will work, but using non-standard ports will make the external page configuration easier.  For example, ports 7000 and 7070 can be used to free up 8000 and 8080 for an external application (ie. mlr).

== Ableton Live Setup ==

Ableton Live should be configured to:

# Send out MIDI Clock on exactly one virtual MIDI device
# Receive MIDI Track and MIDI Remote messages from as many of the other virtual MIDI devices that you need

* Setting up MIDI Clock Sync

# Launch Ableton Live
# Go to Options -> Preferences -> MIDI / Sync tab.
# Verify that you can see your virtual MIDI devices, if you don't see them listed then double check your virtual MIDI device settings.
# Choose one device for MIDI Clock Sync.  I generally use the first device (ie. MIDI Yoke 1, IAC Device 1, etc).
# You will see two entries listed for the device, one labeled "Input:" and one labeled "Output:".  Notice that each device has 3 buttons, "Track", "Sync", and "Remote".
# For the Input: device, make sure all 3 buttons are turned off.
# For the Output: device, make sure just the Sync button is turned on.
# On the Audio tab of the preferences pane you will see an "Overall Latency" value.  Make note of this value.
# On the MIDI / Sync tab of the preferences pane click on the small gray arrow to the left of the Output: <virtual device> entry--the one that has Sync enabled.  This should expand the entry and give you a few configuration options.
# Set the MIDI Clock Sync Delay value to be -negative- the "Overall Latency" value from the Audio page, or as close as you can get to it.  For example, if your Overall Latency is 24.7ms, you should set the MIDI Clock Sync Delay to -25ms.

* Setting up MIDI Track and Remote

# In the Preferences / MIDI tab, locate the devices you want Ableton to receive MIDI note and control change messages on.
# Notice that there are two entries for each device, Input and Output.  Make sure that all 3 buttons are disabled on all Output entries for the devices you want to receive MIDI notes and control change messages on.
# Enable Track and Remote on the Input entries of the devices you wish to use.  You can enable both Track and Remote for a device if you want both types of messages to go through it, or just one or the other.
