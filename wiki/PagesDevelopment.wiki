#summary Information on getting started with Pages development.

Pages is written in Java and I use the Eclipse IDE to develop/test it.  Eclipse is a powerful freeware application that can aid development in many programming languages.

The framework has been designed to allow rapid development of new pages by adhering to a Page interface and exposing many utility classes to each page.  This means that all of the work involved in setting up the OSC connection with monome serial, handling button presses and LED messages, receiving MIDI clock signals, Ableton integration, etc. has already been done and is easy to utilize within a page.

A template page has been included to help you get started, and each page class is a self-contained application that can be used for examples.  I highly recommend that you read over a few Java tutorials to get familiar with the language concepts and syntax.

The first step is to download Eclipse from their [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ main website]:

Next you'll need to download a JDK.  You can get a Windows or Linux JDK from sun's website, and an OSX JDK is available through Apple.

[http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp Windows JDK]

(Someone should fill in instructions here for OSX) For Windows, you'll want to get this version:

Next, install the JDK.  For Windows, I generally put it in an easy to remember place, in this example I put it in c:\code\jdk.  It's up to you though:
