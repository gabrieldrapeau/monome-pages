First, download the PagesMIDI-caching zip file.

Unzip the file to a temporary location and copy the PagesMIDI folder inside of it to the MIDI Remote Scripts folder of your Ableton installation.

First, choose which virtual MIDI devices you want to use for the integration.  In this example, MIDI Yoke 1 will be used for input from Pages, and MIDI Yoke 2 will be used for output to Pages.  Substitute IAC Devices for MIDI Yokes if you're on OSX.

  # Select PagesMIDI as a control surface.  Select MIDI Yoke 1 as the input and MIDI Yoke 2 as the output.
  # Turn off Track/Sync/Remote for MIDI Yoke 1, both the input and the output device.
  # Turn off Track/Remote for MIDI Yoke 2's output device but leave Sync on.  Turn off Track/Sync/Remote for MIDI Yoke 2's input device.  You should only have one button turned on for all MIDI Yoke 1 and 2 devices.

Enable MIDI Yoke 1 as a MIDI Output.

Set the Ableton settings in Pages to use MIDI with MIDI Yoke 2 as the input and MIDI Yoke 1 as the output.

That's it! The Ableton pages should now work.
