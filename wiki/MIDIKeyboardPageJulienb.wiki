= Page Description =

The MIDI Keyboard page allows the monome to be played like a MIDI Keyboard.  All notes are mapped into the selected key/scale.
It fits with my configuration.

|| not1 || not2 || not3 || not4 || not5 || not6 || not7 || ---- ||
|| not1 || not2 || not3 || not4 || not5 || not6 || not7 || ---- ||
|| not1 || not2 || not3 || not4 || not5 || not6 || not7 || ---- ||

|| scl1 || scl2 || scl3 || scl4 || scl5 || scl6 || scl7 || ---- ||

Each not1, not2, not3, etc. row represents the notes of the selected scale in a particular octave.

The chnN buttons allow toggling between the midi channel that note messages will be sent on.

The c, c#, d, etc. buttons allow toggling between the selected key.

The scl buttons allow selection of the scale.  scl1 = major, scl2 = minor, scl3 and scl4 are indian-sounding and blues-sounding scales, scl4 5 6 & 7 will be implemented.
